# Catgram (Front End)

For this project, we attempted to clone a website of our choice. I decided to make a version of Instagram for cats...

## Getting Started

This project is not finished. Currently you need to find a user in the database, and enter their username and password in order to log in.

Once logged in, you can view your feed of fellow cats! Each post displays:
- Username
- Location
- An image
- Caption
- Dislike button

Disliking a photo will cause the user to hiss at you.

You can log out by pressing the "log out" button.

### Installing

Right now, the code likely won't run on GH Pages, so you might have to download the code yourself...

## Running the tests

**Features I would like to add if I had more time:**
- You will not be able to view the page without the proper auth token.
- Logging out will delete the auth token
- You will be able to register a new account
- Endless scroll -> more posts will load once you get near the bottom
- The ability to search for other users
- The ability to follow other users
- Commenting on a post
- Disliking a post will add to the dislike tally
- The ability to:
  - Upload a photo
  - Create a caption
  - Post the photo to your feed
- Clean up code
